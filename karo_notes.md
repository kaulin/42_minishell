**Builtins**
- All builtÂ­in functions are executed by the parent process because we want to modify the state of the parent
- At what point do we check if we are dealing with a builtin and if there is a right amount of arguments for them?
- Can we use printf or would e.g. ft_putstring_fd() be better?
