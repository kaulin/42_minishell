**Builtins**
- All builtÂ­in functions are executed by the parent process because we want to modify the state of the parent?
- At what point do we check if we are dealing with a builtin and if there is a right amount of arguments for them?
- Can we use printf or would e.g. ft_putstring_fd() be better?

**To be corrected/taken into consideration**
- Need to check the forms of valid identifiers with export. Variables can only start with alphabets or '_'.
- Malloc protection!
