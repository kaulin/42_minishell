**TO DO**
- Check builtin arguments, if there are possible commands or expansions inside them and if we need to handle them somehow.Echo!
- Correct EXIT_SUCCESS/FAILURE
- Check malloc and function call protection
- Check the forms of valid identifiers with export. Variables can only start with alphabets or '_'?
- Handle several redirections/files inside sigle command
- Handle heredoc by making another pipe where the input is written and where it can be read from
- Check if PATH_MAX still works in linux as it should
- Correct error handling and make it uniform.
- Echo: is there a space after the last word to be shown
- Adding a new variable with export doesn't work
